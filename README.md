# HTML Tutorial

This repository contains basic HTML files I created while learning how to build simple web pages.

It was part of my early learning phase to understand the structure and elements of HTML.

Feel free to explore or use these files for practice or reference.

## ðŸ“š What I Learned

- Structure of an HTML document
- Tags and elements (`<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, etc.)
- Text formatting (`<h1>` to `<h6>`, `<p>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`)
- Links and images (`<a>`, `<img>`)
- Lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`)
- Tables and forms
- Semantic HTML (`<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, etc.)
- Embedding media (videos, audio)
- Basic page layout using HTML

## ðŸ›  Files Included
